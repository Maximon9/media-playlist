# MediaVault

## Introduction

### What it's for

**MediaVault** is an OBS plugin that adds a new source type called **MediaVault**.  
It acts like a media playlist, allowing you to queue up multiple videos, images, or any media OBS supports.

### Why I made it

I created MediaVault because I wanted a simple way to make a playlist that, once finished, would **infinitely loop the last media**.

Existing OBS options didnâ€™t easily support this use case, so MediaVault fills that gap with lightweight, easy-to-control playlist functionality.

## Features

#### **Multi MediaVault Queue Viewer**

-   This is a dock in the dockers tab above that allows you to view the queue of all MediaVaults.

#### **Show Queue Button**

-   The properties window for this source has a show queue button.

#### **Stretch Sodes**

-   by default it's free meaning that no stretching of any kind is done to the media.

#### **Shuffle Queue**

-   This allows the list of media in the queue to be shuffled.

#### **Start Behavior**

-   This is the behavior for when the source is activated by switching to the scene it is in.

#### **An End Behavior**

-   This is the behavior for when the playlist reaches the end.

#### **Looping**

#### **Looping Last Media**

-   This loops the last media a set ammount or infinitely.

#### **Mediia History Limit**

-   Mainly for when activating shuffling.

#### **Debug**

-   Mainly for dev perposes.

I didn't steal any code, but it did help me understand to make the audio portion of it all work.
